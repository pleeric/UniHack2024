## ShopSwipe
ShopSwipe is an application that aims to simplify online shopping using scrolling and swiping used in common social media applications. ShopSwipe gathers various clothing items from various fashion brands and displays them to the user, who can swipe left or right, to indicate whether or not they like the item, which is then used to generate recommendations based on the similarity of other products (similar to the TikTok algorithm).

## My contribution
My contribution focused on web scraping, to gather information about clothing products on the Myer fashion website. Once clothing items are scraped, they are classified on type of clothing item using Tensorflow (shirt, pants, shoes etc.), along with information on the name and price of the product. This was coded in Python, using libraries like JSON, sqlite3, and BeautifulSoup4.

## Future Goals
This project is incomplete, with most of the front end missing (or not functional). For future implementations, the focus will be on creating swiping and scrolling animations, before expanding this project to a mobile application and website. 

For the backend, I will focus on re-designing the recommendation algorithm to implement probabilistic acceptance for items to recommend based on attributes like colour, type of clothing, price etc.
